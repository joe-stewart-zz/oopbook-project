#OOPBOOK-PROJECT

Version 1.2

    Corresponds to the fifth and final programming project, with serialization
    and RDB persistence implemented. A skeleton only has been included for text
    persistence.

Version 1.1

    Placed classes into packages to match fourth programming project, final
    version. GUI code is updated from the booksite to support Student roles, and
    has been cleaned up for legibility.

Version 1.0

    Corresponds to the third programming project, but with a singleton University
    class. The GUI code is from the booksite, but the formatting has been cleaned
    up. Two calls to the University constructor in StudentApplication were changed
    to calls to getInstance().
