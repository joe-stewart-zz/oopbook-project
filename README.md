#OOPBOOK-PROJECT

Version 1.0

    Corresponds to the third programming project, but with a singleton University
    class. The GUI code is from the booksite, but the formatting has been cleaned
    up. Two calls to the University constructor in StudentApplication were changed
    to calls to getInstance().
